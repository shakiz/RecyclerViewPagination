# RecyclerViewPagination
Recycler view is a googd component in replace of other viewgroup like as listview.Here in this project i have implemented how 
we can do pagination in recyclerview item.I use some random data to load by calling default random() method in java.In that place you guys may use your server response data.In future i will be trying to update a new project where i will be implementing how we can do pagination in recyclerview and load the data from server by calling api.We will be using retrofit for our client.
